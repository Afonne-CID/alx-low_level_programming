This project is on 'argc' and 'argv' main() arguments in the C programming language. We will discover how to use arguments passed to the program, what the two prototypes of main() [(int main(void)), and (int main(int argc, char *argv[]))] are, as well as the use case of which. Then finally, how to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused functions with unused variables or parameters

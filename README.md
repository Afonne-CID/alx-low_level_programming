# alx-low_level_programming

The set of projects in this Repo explores the C Programming Language, touching on pointers, pointer-to-pointers and their use cases, what's multi-dimensional array and how to use them, what are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings, etc.

# NOTE
Just as true as it is that everyday is an opportunity to learn in the IT world, it is also worth knowing that; the codes/projects below were handled while I was still very much at the infantry stage into my career: There's every possibility that I am better of, by the time you are reading this.

Thanks.
